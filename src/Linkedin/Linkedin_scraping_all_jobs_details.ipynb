You’ll be the trusted technical advisors for our customers, driving business value, offering advice, and growing accounts. You’ll accomplish this by leading customers to solutions oftentimes by teaching the product to new users or consulting on best practices. You must be ready for technical discussions with data scientists and engineers, then demonstrate the value of Arize in business discussions with directors and executives. The goal is to enable our customers to become successful and enthusiastic about Arize.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe estimated annual salary and variable compensation for this role is between $125,000 - $195,000, plus a competitive equity package.
